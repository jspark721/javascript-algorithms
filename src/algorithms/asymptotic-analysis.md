## Asymptotic Analysis

The design & analysis of algorithms (e.g., "the big-o notation")
- the sweet spot for high-level reasoning about Algorithms
- coarse enough to suppress architecture/ choice of programming language/ compiler/
- sharp enough to make useful comparisons between different algorithms, especially true for large inputs (e.g., sorting or integer multiplication, etc.)

##### High-level idea: suppress constant factors & lower-order terms

constant factors: too system-dependent
lower-order terms: irrelevant for large inputs
