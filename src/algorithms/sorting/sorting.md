## Sorting

A sorting algorithm puts elements of a list in a certain order. Efficient sorting is important for optimizing the efficiency of algorithms (such as search and merge algorithms) which require input data to be in sorted lists. Sorting is also often useful for canonicalizing data and for producing human-readable output

The performance of these algorithms can vary widely. Some algorithms are complex but work fast. Some are slow but very easy to write.
